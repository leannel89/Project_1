## Wireframing ##

Following the advise of my mentor Marcel I redeveloped the wireframe to commence a mobile first approach. 

Basic wireframes were created using Balsamiq Cloud. I went a little further almost to mockup level to help visualise the development needed. Having the skeleton in place focused subsequent coding.

This was a learning curve as i then moved from a one page navigation to separate landing pages, as the content felt too sparse, and didn’t work based on my current skillset. 

## Colour Scheme ##

The colour scheme was devised from a pinterest board in which I collated in advance of the project commencement, the site is aimed at a corporate audience so it needed to be clean, easily read and not too “out-there”.

## Header Logo & Navigation ##

While the company logo was developed for an aesthetic reason, a secondary logo was created for readability in the navigation bar. 

The header is fixed on all devices to allow ease of navigation, the navigation section moves from underneath to the right when via mobile, hover affects are also utilised to aid in user navigation.

## About Page ##

The landing page has a hero background of eucalyptus faded out slightly with the logo placed in the centre keeping in theme with I love ucaplptus pinterst theme.  This image is to covey a clean and calm space to the user.

The footer is an important element as the company wishes to gain social media following, this was placed on every page and set out in a clear format with logos
