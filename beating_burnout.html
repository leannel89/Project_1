             <h2>Beating Burnout</h2>
        </a>
            <p>The following techniques are proven to assist in combatting burnout or steering you away from that feeling, and these can be implemented in your company or in your routine straight away.

                        <h2>Incorporating Mindfulness</h2>
                        <p>Being in the moment entails avoiding rumination (past problems), worry (future problems), and distraction (present problems). There is always space for interpretation of terms like this, but the main focus of somebody trying to practice mindfulness should stay being in the moment and avoiding irrelevant stressors.
                            Say out loud or write down how you are feeling, what you can control and what you cant, these simple steps can bring you back from feeling overwhelmed

                Curating Your Workstation
            </h2>
                <p>The physical environment of the workplace has a significant effect on the way that we work. When our space is a mess, so are we.
                That is certainly true from a simple logistical perspective: we lose precious work minutes every time we go searching for a lost paper on a cluttered desk. Take a moment to clear paperwork from your desk, wipe away dust, clear your inbox, even digital clutter can affect us.</p>

                <h2>The Benefits of Changing your Desktop Wallpaper
                </h2>
                <p>Apart from the usual medical tips that you should take a few minutes off for every hour you spend in front of the computer, there is also another way to ease your eye strain. This is choosing a soothing desktop wallpaper or background so that you can still sit in front of it without stressing your eyes. There are so many kinds of high-quality desktop wallpapers you can choose from that can soothe and stimulate your visual senses. For example, try nature photos in bold, beautiful colors that will make you feel as if you're really sitting near a waterfall or lying on the grass. Landscapes are good, too, particularly movie scenes of beautiful places like the city of Paris or cherry blossom festivals in Japan.
                </p>
                <p>Here is one to get you started :

<!--Exercise-->
<section>
    <div id="exercise">
        <h2>
            Exercise
        </h2>
        <p>
            Exercise has potential to be an effective burnout intervention. Different types of exercise may assist you or your employees in different ways. Organisations wishing to proactively reduce burnout can do so by encouraging their employees to access regular exercise programs, start a lunch time yoga class or walking group.
